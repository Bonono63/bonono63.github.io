 This is a rather uncreatively named game I made in 2 weeks for the Game Creation Club at The Ohio State University.
 It is a simple puzzle game inspired by the Flash game Bloxorz, The GameBoy Advanced Game The Legend Of Zelda: The Minish Cap, and Sokoban.
 Some of my friends have told me it is hard, though as the game designer/developer its grown difficult to see that perspective.
 The game was made in the Godot game engine using GDscript. I was responsible for all the programming and art direction in the game.
 I had anticipated making this in a custom engine like I did one of my other projects, CeresVoxel.
 After the first day I realized that I'd be shooting myself in the foot for no reason if I wanted a finished product.
 A friend of mine produced all the music for the game and all the sound effects where freely available online under the public domain.
 I had a relatively cohesive vision for the game and my only regret is not spending some time optimizing it and not testing it on more machines/in browsers.
 Otherwise I am very satisfied with the final product.

 A work in progress Minecraft clone that I intend to replace my modded Minecraft addiction with.
 Starting in Feburary of 2025 I began making a custom game engine with the sole intent of making a Minecraft-like automation game with strong survival elements.
 The game will take inspiration from Space Engineers, Kerbal Space Program, Factorio, Gregtech, Create, Valkyrien Skies, Clockwork, Railcraft, Traincraft, and more. This is my Magnum Opus if you will.
 I want it to run on a toaster and have a wonderful stylized aesthetic. I don't really quite expect it to come out in even 5 years, but it all depends on whether I can finish the physics.
 It utilizes Vulkan for graphics and is primarily written in Zig (C-like Systems programming language).

 <p>
  An OpenGL graphics demo that renders voxels (textured cubes) relatively novely.
  This is still a rasterized approach to rendering voxels, but it is not greedy meshing or traditional.
  Instead of dividing each block into a single set of vertices;
  A large chunk of voxels is turned into a texture and then put onto one big face.
  Since the voxels are grid aligned you can use transparency within the texture and layers of faces to produce voxels.
  This of course has the draw back of terrible overdraw, but its kind of cool.
  One day I'll test whether this is a viable approach for an actual game.
  Maybe once I have a benchmarking suit in CeresVoxel I'll give it another shot.
