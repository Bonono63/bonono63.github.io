  Who am I?<br><br><br>
  My name is Diego Noria. I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at The Ohio State University.
  <br>I am an aspiring Game Developer, Software Engineer, Mechanic, Artist, and Musician.
  <br>I am currently learning Japanese and have been for the past year.
   I've slowly become literate, it's been both brutally difficult and wonderful. I hope to live abroad at least once in my life (We'll see if it becomes indefinite).
  One day I also wish to travel the United States in a heavily modified camper van. I'm hoping it'll force me substantially closer to nature than I currently am.
  I used to camp quite frequently and I've lost touch with that part of me ever since I aged out of Boyscouts.
  I am largely self taught in everything I do. I have found school to be quite unproductive for me, so I have developed a very practical perspective on teaching myself topics.
  I know I'm not alone in this, but learning through projects has taught me much more than purely studying a text book for a test.
  
  <br><br>General hobbies include:
  <br>Watching anime, reading manga, programming, playing video games, drawing, making music, digging through internet archives, tinkering with keyboards,
  enjoying the outdoors (I don't go out as much as I should), drinking tea (before noon so I can fall asleep), and more!
  <br><br>Music (Genres and Artists) I enjoy:
  <br>Camellia, Black Sabbath, VOCALOID (Most things tuned by Adam Edmond), some Umamusume tracks, J-ROCK, kawaii metal (BABYMETAL), Bosa Nova, Latin music (Música Venezuelana), House, Hardstyle and derivates, Industrial, Hardcore (EDM), Breakcore (old and new), Gabber, (EDM is maybe too broad to list more...), Nujabes, Indie Rock, Gorillaz (Especially Demon Days), Ambient EDM, classic rock, YES, traditional chinese/japanese music, metal, the Calamity Mod Original Sound Track, and more.
  <br><br>Movies I enjoy:
  <br>Blade Runner, <br>Ghost In The Shell (1995), <br>REDLINE (If you have not seen this YOU NEED TO), <br>WALL-E, <br>Ratatouille, <br>Star Wars (Primarily the first 2 trilogies, we don't talk about what Disney has done), <br>Interstellar, <br>Any of the Umamusume movies

  <br><br>Manga I enjoy:

   <marquee scrollamount="6">Hi! Hello! You made it to the bottom! Do you think marquees are distracting? That's why I decided to put this at the bottom of the page I guess. How do you like my website? It doesn't have much, but maybe it will some day... Should I make it more pazzazi? Like throw more stuff on it and make it more personalzed? I already think the color scheme and simplicity makes it sort of stand out, but I think there's more I can do...</marquee>
